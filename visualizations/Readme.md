### Visualizations
We visualize our findings as a treemap diagram. This diagram enables users to view the different AI techniques used in all the cycles and application areas of the product creation process.

There are two treemap diagrams
 - **treemap_clustered:** A 3-level treemap displaying the AI techniques in each application area, in each cycle of the product creation process.
 - **treemap_simplified:** A 2-level treemap displaying the AI techniques in each product creation cycle.

To better visualize the output, one can download these files and view them in a web browser.
